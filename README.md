"# SORTING-ALGORITHM-VIZULIZER" 
A console-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built in C++ that demonstrates how popular sorting algorithms work internally through step-by-step visualization, performance comparison, and time complexity analysis.

This project was developed as a group project to strengthen our understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms, C++ programming, and algorithm performance analysis.

🚀 Features

🔹 Visual step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms

🔹 Comparison and swap counters

🔹 Execution time measurement

🔹 Multiple input data scenarios:

Random array

Sorted array (Best Case)

Nearly sorted array

Reverse array (Worst Case)

Custom user input

Random array with custom range

🔹 Interactive menu-driven console interface

🔹 Colorful visualization using Windows Console API

🧠 Algorithms Implemented
Algorithm	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
Bubble Sort	O(n)	O(n²)	O(n²)
Selection Sort	O(n²)	O(n²)	O(n²)
Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)
Quick Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n²)
🖥️ Visualization Support

Visualization can be enabled or disabled

Supported for array sizes ≤ 100

Larger arrays are used for accurate performance benchmarking

⚙️ Technologies Used

C++

Windows Console API

<ctime> for performance measurement

<conio.h> for keyboard interaction

<windows.h> for colors & cursor control

⚠️ This project is Windows-only due to usage of windows.h.
